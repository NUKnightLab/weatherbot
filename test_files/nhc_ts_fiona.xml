DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 65.5 West. Fiona is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A 
northwestward motion is expected to begin later today and continue 
through Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will 
pass southwest of the U.S. Virgin Islands and approach Puerto Rico 
this morning, and then move near or over Puerto Rico this afternoon 
or evening. Fiona will then move near the northern coast of the 
Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or to the east of 
the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 
km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and Fiona is 
expected to become a hurricane before reaching the southern or 
southwestern coast of Puerto Rico later today. Additional 
strengthening is expected on Monday and Tuesday while Fiona moves 
over the southwestern Atlantic.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
from the center. A wind gust of 48 mph (78 km/h) was recently 
reported at Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on St. Croix.
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico today, and 
are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican Republic tonight 
and Monday. Hurricane conditions are possible in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands this morning. Hurricane conditions are possible within the 
hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the U.S. and British 
Virgin Islands, and will spread westward across Puerto Rico this 
morning and across portions of the Dominican Republic later today. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch area in the 
Dominican Republic tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 inches
or less.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local maximum of
10 inches possible.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 20 inches
possible, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Dominican Republic: 4 to 7 inches with local maximum 10 inches
possible, particularly on the far eastern coast.
 
Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 6 inches.
 
These rains are likely to produce life-threatening flash flooding
and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
particularly in Puerto Rico and portions of the eastern Dominican
Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft
U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands, 
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the 
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
