 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was <br />
 located near latitude 27.8 North, longitude 71.0 West. Franklin is <br />
 moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). This northward to <br />
 north-northeastward motion with a slightly faster forward speed is <br />
 expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, the <br />
 center of Franklin is expected to pass well west of Bermuda on <br />
 Wednesday.<br />
  <br />
 Based on data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft, <br />
 maximum sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) <br />
 with higher gusts.  Franklin is a category 4 hurricane on the <br />
 Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is <br />
 possible today, but gradual weakening is expected to begin later <br />
 Tuesday.<br />
  <br />
 Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the<br />
 center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles<br />
 (240 km).<br />
  <br />
 The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb based on data from<br />
 aircraft reconnaissance (27.67 inches).<br />
  <br />
  <br />
 HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 SURF:  Swells, life-threatening surf and rip currents generated by <br />
 Franklin are beginning to affect Bermuda and the Southeast United <br />
 States and are expected to spread northward along the east coast of <br />
 the United States, Atlantic Canada, during the next couple of days.<br />
 <br />
 WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch<br />
 area by Wednesday morning.<br />
  <br />
