 A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected <br />
 somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued 36 <br />
 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of <br />
 tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside <br />
 preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life <br />
 and property should be rushed to completion.A Hurricane Warning <br />
 means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the <br />
 warning area, in this case within the next 12-24 hours.  <br />
 Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to <br />
 completion.<br />
  <br />
 A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-<br />
 threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the<br />
 coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.<br />
 For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather<br />
 Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at<br />
 hurricanes.gov.<br />
  <br />
 A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible<br />

 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was<br />
 located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 85.2 West. Idalia is<br />
 moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A northward motion<br />
 is expected through tonight, followed by a faster north-northeast<br />
 motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center<br />
 of Idalia is forecast to pass near or over western Cuba tonight,<br />
 over the extreme southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early Tuesday, and<br />
 reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.<br />
  <br />
 Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher<br />
 gusts.   Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane later today and a<br />
 dangerous major hurricane over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico by<br />
 early Wednesday.<br />
  <br />
 Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)<br />
 from the center.<br />
  <br />
 The latest minimum central pressure estimated from data from an Air<br />
 Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 990 mb (29.24 inches).<br />
  <br />
  <br />
 HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone<br />
 Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,<br />
 and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml<br />
  <br />
 STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the<br />
 tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by<br />
 rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could<br />
 reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated<br />
 areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...<br />
  <br />
 Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft<br />
 Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft<br />
 Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft<br />
 Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft<br />
 Tampa Bay...4-7 ft<br />
 Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft<br />
 Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft<br />
 Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft<br />
 Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft<br />
 Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Altamaha Sound, GA...2-4 ft<br />
 Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft<br />
 Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's <br />
 River...1-3 ft<br />
 Florida Keys...1-2 ft<br />
 <br />
 The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of<br />
 onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and<br />
 dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative<br />
 timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over<br />
 short distances. For information specific to your area, please see<br />
 products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast<br />
 office.<br />
  <br />
 Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above<br />
 normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.<br />
 Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.<br />
  <br />
 WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane<br />
 warning area in western Cuba later today.  Winds are expected to<br />
 first reach tropical storm strength by this morning, making<br />
 outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to<br />
 protect life and property should be rushed to completion.<br />
  <br />
 Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the<br />
 tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle<br />
 of Youth in Cuba through today<br />
  <br />
 Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area <br />
 in Florida by late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm <br />
 conditions beginning on Tuesday.<br />
  <br />
 Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas <br />
 beginning late today and within the tropical storm warning area <br />
 along the Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.<br />
  <br />
 RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall <br />
 amounts:<br />
 <br />
 Portions of the eastern Yucatan: Additional 1 to 2 inches.<br />
 <br />
 Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10 <br />
 inches.<br />
 <br />
 Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, <br />
 southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from <br />
 Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible, <br />
 primarily near landfall in northern Florida.<br />
 <br />
 This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides <br />
 across western Cuba. <br />
 <br />
 Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally <br />
 significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of <br />
 Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into <br />
 Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas <br />
 Wednesday into Thursday.<br />
  <br />
 SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the<br />
 southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells are<br />
 likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.<br />
 Please consult products from your local weather office.<br />
 <br />
 TORNADO: A few tornadoes will be possible starting Tuesday along the <br />
 west central Florida coast and the tornado threat will spread <br />
 northward into the Florida Big Bend area by Tuesday night.<br />
  <br />
