 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was<br />
 located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 84.8 West.  Idalia is<br />
 moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A faster motion<br />
 toward the north and north-northeast is expected through early<br />
 Wednesday while Idalia approaches the Gulf coast of Florida.  A<br />
 turn toward the northeast and east-northeast is forecast late<br />
 Wednesday and Thursday, bringing the center of Idalia near or along<br />
 the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas.<br />
  <br />
 Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)<br />
 with higher gusts.  Rapid intensification is expected before<br />
 landfall, and Idalia is forecast to be a major hurricane when it<br />
 reaches the Gulf coast of Florida Wednesday morning.<br />
  <br />
 Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the<br />
 center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles<br />
 (260 km).<br />
  <br />
 The estimated minimum central pressure from NOAA Hurricane Hunter <br />
 aircraft data is 976 mb (28.82 inches).<br />
  <br />
  <br />
 HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND<br />
 ----------------------<br />
 Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone<br />
 Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,<br />
 and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml<br />
  <br />
 STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the<br />
 tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by<br />
 rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could<br />
 reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated<br />
 areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...<br />
  <br />
 Aucilla River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...10-15 ft<br />
 Yankeetown to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft<br />
 Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft<br />
 Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...6-9 ft<br />
 Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft<br />
 Tampa Bay...4-7 ft<br />
 Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-7 ft<br />
 Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft<br />
 Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft<br />
 Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft<br />
 Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft<br />
 Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft<br />
 South Santee, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft<br />
 Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft<br />
 Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3<br />
 ft<br />
 Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft.<br />
 Florida Keys...1-2 ft<br />
  <br />
 The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of<br />
 onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and<br />
 dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative<br />
 timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over<br />
 short distances. For information specific to your area, please see<br />
 products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast<br />
 office.<br />
  <br />
 Elevated water levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio,<br />
 Cuba will gradually subside today.<br />
  <br />
 WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected to<br />
 continue within the warning areas in western Cuba for the next few<br />
 hours.<br />
  <br />
 Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area<br />
 in Florida by tonight or early Wednesday, with tropical storm<br />
 conditions beginning today.<br />
  <br />
 Tropical storm conditions are likely beginning in the Dry Tortugas<br />
 and will begin within the tropical storm warning area along the<br />
 Florida Gulf coast and the Florida west coast later today.<br />
  <br />
 Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the<br />
 warning area along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South<br />
 Carolina.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch<br />
 area in South and North Carolina Wednesday night and Thursday.<br />
  <br />
 RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall <br />
 amounts:<br />
 <br />
 Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10 <br />
 inches.<br />
 <br />
 Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, <br />
 southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from <br />
 Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible, <br />
 primarily near landfall in northern Florida.<br />
 <br />
 This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides <br />
 across western Cuba. <br />
 <br />
 Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally <br />
 significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of <br />
 Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into <br />
 Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas <br />
 Wednesday into Thursday.<br />
  <br />
 SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the<br />
 southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells will<br />
 spread northward along the eastern United States Gulf Coast during<br />
 the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-<br />
 threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult<br />
 products from your local weather office.<br />
  <br />
 TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible along the west central <br />
 Florida coast through tonight.  The tornado threat will also spread <br />
 northward into the Florida Big Bend tonight, and toward southeast <br />
 Georgia and the coastal Carolinas Wednesday.<br />
  <br />
