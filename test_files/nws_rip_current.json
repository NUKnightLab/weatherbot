        "instruction": "There is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

        "description": "Showers and thunderstorms associated with the Tropical Storm\nFranklin...now located about 350 miles southwest of Ponce and 425\nmiles west-southwest of Saint Croix...will continue to spread\nacross Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through the middle\nof the workweek.\n\nRainbands, with scattered to numerous showers and isolated\nthunderstorms, continue to spread across the region. The\npotential for showers and thunderstorms will continue on Tuesday\nand Wednesday. The resulting rains will maintain an elevated risk\nfor urban and small stream flooding as well as flash flooding,\nwhich could also lead to mudslides and rapid river rises.\n\nBased on the most recent guidance, the areas most likely to\nreceive the highest rainfall accumulations are eastern and\nsouthern sections of Puerto Rico. In these areas, there is the\npotential for additional rainfall totals of 1-3 inches with\nisolated higher amounts. Elsewhere across Puerto Rico and across\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, rainfall totals of 1-2 inches with\nisolated higher amounts are possible.\n\nThis product will be updated as needed. Please, continue to\nmonitor the progress of Franklin as it moves northward across the\ncentral Caribbean.",
